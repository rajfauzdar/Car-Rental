# Car-Rental
Car Rental is based on the concept of renting cars and generate a rental invoice for a rental company.
In order to run the project, you must have installed Dev C++ or Code Blocks on your PC. 
This system has an admin and user sections. Before stepping into the main system an admin has to pass through a login system to get access, then only the user can add cars with a different model and reset available cars, add admins, and so on. This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one.
